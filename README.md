# Driver-Ed
This app will be used by high school students in Drivers Ed in as a smart learning tool order to help them gauge their performance. 
Included in the app are safety features that monitor factors such as speed, acceleration, direction, blinkers on/off, and braking. 
There is an in-app simulation of course navigation which will voice instructions to the driver of the car.
At the end of the course once the car has been parked, the app will give the user a report of their performance including the errors made in driving. 
These features will allow the driver to show their driving performance to the DMV as proof of safe driving when they go to get their license.
