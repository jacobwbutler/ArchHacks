# ArchHacks
ArchHacks 2016 Project

Your personal communication channel with your doctor.
We make sure that your doctor has as much actionable data as possible, making smarter decisions and saving costs.

We also implement friendly reminders to help make sure customer prescriptions are taken regularly and correctly.
